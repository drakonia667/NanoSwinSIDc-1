NanoSwinSIDc
============

The [SwinSID](http://www.swinkels.tvtom.pl/swinsid/) is a drop-in replacement for the MOS 6581 and
MOS 8580 sound chips. It is **not** fully compatible and it lacks certain
features.

The NanoSwinSIDc board layout was created using KiCAD and it is heavily based on
[the NanoSinSIDb](http://www.tolaemon.com/nss/) made by Tolaemon.
